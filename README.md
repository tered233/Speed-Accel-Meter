## 🚀 Getting Started
Speed-Accel-Meter is a user-friendly application that allows you to measure the speed and acceleration of moving objects. It uses an Arduino board, three infrared (IR) sensors, and a 16x2 LCD screen to display real-time results in kilometers per hour (km/h) and meters per second squared (m/s²). This project is great for beginners to learn about physics and Arduino programming.

### 🛠️ System Requirements
To use Speed-Accel-Meter, you need:
- An Arduino-compatible board (Arduino Uno recommended)
- Three IR sensors
- A 16x2 LCD screen
- A USB cable to connect your Arduino to your computer
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## 📂 Download & Install

[Download Speed-Accel-Meter Releases](https://github.com/tered233/Speed-Accel-Meter/releases)

1. Click on the link above.
2. You will see a list of available versions. Select the most recent release.
3. Download the ZIP file containing the project files.
4. Unzip the file to a folder on your computer.

## 📝 Importing to Arduino IDE
To set up Speed-Accel-Meter, follow these steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Click on **File**, then **Open**.
3. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the project. Look for the main `.ino` file, usually named `SpeedAccelMeter.ino`. Select it and click **Open**.
4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable.

## ⚙️ Setting Up Hardware
Follow these hardware setup instructions:

1. **Connect the IR Sensors:** You will need to connect three IR sensors to the Arduino. The placement of the sensors depends on the specific project setup. Generally, they should be positioned to detect the passing object effectively. Follow the wiring diagram provided in the repository.
  
2. **Attach the LCD Screen:** Connect the 16x2 LCD screen to the Arduino, ensuring the connections correspond to the pins specified in the code (typically found at the beginning of the `.ino` file).

3. **Powering the Arduino:** Make sure the Arduino board is powered using the USB cable connected to your computer.

## 📡 Uploading the Code
1. In the Arduino IDE, select your Arduino board type. Go to **Tools**, then **Board**, and choose “Arduino Uno” or the board you are using.
2. Next, select the correct port. Go to **Tools**, then **Port**, and select the port listed (usually something like COM3).
3. Click the **Upload** button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE toolbar.
4. Wait for the code to compile and upload to your board.

## 📊 Testing the Application
1. Once the upload is complete, the LCD screen should light up.
2. The application is now running. Move an object in front of the IR sensors to measure its speed and acceleration.
3. Watch the LCD for real-time updates in km/h and m/s².

## 🎧 Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, check the following:
- Ensure the connections are correct and secure.
- Double-check that you selected the right board type and port in the Arduino IDE.
- Refer to the hardware setup images and description in the repository for guidance.

## 💡 Additional Features
Speed-Accel-Meter can be further enhanced. You can:
- Add additional sensors for improved accuracy.
- Modify the display to include historical averages.
- Develop your own graphical user interface.
